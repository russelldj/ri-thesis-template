\begin{itemize}
    \item Big picture: how do we provide forest managers with actionable data using only commodity drone hardware and easy-to-use software?
    \item How do we perform semantic mapping in a way that is robust, generalizable, and requires only moderate human efforts? This can be offline but should run in hours, not days. We can only assume uncalibrated images and potentially GPS. We can request a small set of image annotations from a domain expert. 
    \item How do we plan drone missions which maximize our ability to extrapolate beyond the observed regions using remote sensing data? This should scale across different remote sensing modalities and prediction tasks. The plan should be generated for the entire mission in a realistic timeframe e.g. 15 minutes on a laptop. I can depend on the observations from previous missions.
