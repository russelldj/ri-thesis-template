I am sincerely grateful to Prof. George Kantor, Prof. Marija Popovic, and Kshitij Goel for taking the time to serve on my committee for their time and insightful feedback. And especially to my advisor, Prof. David Wettergreen, for all the suggestions, direction, encouragement and understanding. I appreciate both your willingness to let me explore and ability to direct my focus to what matters.

To my labmates, Srini Vijayarangan, Rohan Zeng, Ananya Rao, Maggie Hansen, and Abby Brietfield. Thank you for all the discussions about research and real life. You taught me a lot and made this far more fun.

Much of this work happened in close collaboration with the SAFEFOREST team: Dr. Francisco Yandun, Winnie Kuang, and Duda Andrada. I appreciate the numerous times they have provided me useful data, helped me debug code, or clarify my thoughts. 

%To Eric Schneider, anything I've discussed with you has given . Your organization and preparedness will never cease to amaze me.  

To Dr. Derek Young and Dr. Mike Koontz at Open Forest Observatory, I appreciate your perspectives on how this work really gets done.
