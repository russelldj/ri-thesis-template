\section{Key Takeaways}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Structure from motion is a powerful tool to build 3D maps from drone images with minimal assumptions
    \item A small amount of annotated data can be very useful to train deep learning models for a given natural environment
    \item Predicting trees at increasingly-low resolutions yields better results 
\end{itemize}
\section{Contributions}
\begin{itemize}
    \item A study of tree detection in data at multiple scales 
    \item A novel long-horizon informative path planner for drone surveys
\end{itemize}
\section{Future work}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Adding semantics to meshes 
    \item Studying tree detection with more rigorous ground truth data
    \item Adding height information to semantics and tree detection images
    \item Explore different approaches to dimensionality reduction, such as VAE
    \item Automatically registering data at different scales
    \item Evaluating the performance of different feature extractors
\end{itemize}
