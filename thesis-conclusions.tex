\section{Key Takeaways}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Structure from motion is a powerful tool to build 3D maps from drone images with minimal assumptions
    \item A small amount of annotated data can be very useful to train deep learning models for a given natural environment
    \item Predicting trees at increasingly-low resolutions yields better results 
\end{itemize}
\section{Contributions}
\begin{itemize}
    \item A study  
\end{itemize}
\section{Future work}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Adding semantics to meshes 
    \item Studying tree detection with more rigorous ground truth data
\end{itemize}
