\begin{itemize}
    \item Below canopy mapping is a challenging area which requires online multisensor robotics reasoning
    \item Above canopy mapping can be accomplished with commodity drones 
    \item Stucture from motion is a powerful tool to build 3D maps from drone images with minimal assumptions
    \item Semantic segmentation on images is an easy way to classify vegetation types with limited human effort
    \item Semantic meshes are a good way to aggregate observations from multiple viewpoints and tolerate some miss-classifications
    \item Satellite data can be used to extrapolate beyond the region observed by drones
    \item A long-horizon planner which prioritizes diverse samples can improve the quality of predictions on the broader region
\end{itemize}
